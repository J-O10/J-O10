ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Joe. I am 26 from the UK and I am obsessed with technology. 
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things Microsoft, Apple and Linux but I am a general tinkerer and love to experiment with both software and hardware.
I am currently employed as a 3rd line IT Engineer and I am in love with what I do. 
I am using Github as a centralised repository for scripts I find useful and for connecting with others who share the same passion as I do.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... Github
